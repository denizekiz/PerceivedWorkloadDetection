# HRVTool v0.99
## Methods for analyzing Heart Rate Variability

The present functions are made for Matlab R2015a. Errors may occur using older releases (at least R2014b required). Since v0.96 additional toolboxes are not required to run the basic analysis. The Image Processing Toolbox is required to use the 'picker'-functionality.

**HRV.m** is a Matlab class containing function for analyzing HRV.
**HRVTool.m** contains the code to start the GUI (Graphical User Interface) on Matlab.
**HRVTool.mlappinstall** is the app package which can be installed with Matlab.

Please run HRVTool.m to start the GUI or click on the icon in the App menu of Matlab.
The user interface has been tested on Windows 7 64bit, Linux Ubuntu 14.04 and Mac OS 10.9.
